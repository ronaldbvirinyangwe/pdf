1.1. INTRODUCTION

The Heritage-based Agriculture is a science learning area that involves theory and
practical activities. This four year learning phase (Form 1 - 4) will provide all learners
with opportunities to identify, investigate, solve problems, carry out agricultural
activities and assess their viability in a sustainable manner. The learning phase will
see_all learners being assessed through School Based Continuous Assessment
(SBCA) and Summative Assessment (SA).

1.2 RATIONALE

Since Zimbabwe’s economy is agro - based, the nation embarked on an agrarian
land reform and therefore it is imperative that learners in their diversity acquire
necessary agricultural knowledge, skills and positive attitudes. This would enable all
learners to be proactive, productive and add value to the national economy.
Heritage-based Agriculture enables Learners to value the dignity of labour and

harness available resources for enterprise development.

1.3 SUMMARY OF CONTENT
The Form 1 — 4 Heritage-based Agriculture Syllabus will cover theory and practical

activities. This four year learning phase seeks to develop skills in sustainable soil and
water management, farm tools and machinery use as well as production of agricultural
commodities. The syllabus will help all learners to acquire marketing and value

addition skills.

1.4 ASSUMPTIONS
It is assumed that all learners have practical skills and knowledge of:

° growing plants and rearing of animals


--- Page 5 ---
the use of farm tools, implements and machinery
marketing of agricultural produce

the use of resources in a sustainable manner

1.5 CROSS-CUTTING THEMES

The following are some of the cross-cutting themes in Agriculture:

Gender equity

Disaster risk management

Health and wellbeing

Environmental management

practice should be prioritised in the teaching and learning of Agriculture.

The following are suggested methods of teaching and learning of Agriculture:

« Project based learning
* Research

¢ Educational tours

¢ E-learning

« Experimentation

« Problem solving

¢« Discovery method

* Demonstrations

* Debate

¢ Discussions

¢ Design based learning
¢ Dramatisation/role play
* Case studies

¢ Gallery walk

« Resource person(s)

* . Simulations

* Song and Dance

« Survey

5.2 Time Allocation

8.0 ASSESSMENT

Learners shall be assessed through School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA)
and Summative Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles
of inclusivity, practicability, authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity and reliability.
The principles are crucial for creating a supportive and effective learning environment
that fosters growth and development in learners. Arrangements, accommodations and
modifications shall be visible to enable candidates with special needs to access

assessments.

This section covers the assessment objectives, the assessment model, the scheme of

assessment, and the specification grid.

8.1 ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES
Learners will be assessed on their ability to:

8.1.1 outline control measures of pests, diseases and parasites of a named
agricultural enterprise

8.1.2 interpret and evaluate the profitability of a given agricultural enterprise

8.1.3 describe the anatomy and physiology of named plants and animals

8.1.4 illustrate breeding processes in plants and animals

8.1.5 outline the effects of the environment on crop and animal production

8.1.6 discuss the production of a named plant and animal up to marketing

8.1.7 outline the socio-economic importance of agriculture to the family, community
and the nation

8.1.8 discuss health and safety measures in agriculture

8.1.9 correctly use and maintain any given agricultural equipment

8.1.10 describe and maintain named agricultural structures

8.1.11 design experiments and correctly interpret the results

8.1.12 apply acquired skills, knowledge and information to solve agricultural problems
in the community

8.1.13 maintain accurate physical and financial records of a named agricultural
enterprise

8.1.14 explain the socio-economic importance of wildlife and forestry


--- Page 86 ---
8.1.15 justify the importance of land tenure on agricultural activities in Zimbabwe

8.2 Assessment Model

Assessment of learners shall be both Continuous and Summative as illustrated in
Figure 1. School Based Continuous Assessment shall include recorded activities from
the School Based Projects done by the learners. The mark shall be included on
learners’ end of term and year reports. Summative assessment at school level shall
include terminal examinations which are at the end of the term and year.

In addition, learners shall be profiled and learner profile records established. Learner
profile certificates shall be issued for checkpoints assessment in schools as per the
dictates of the Teacher’s Guide to Learning and Assessment. The aspects to be
profiled shall include learner's prior knowledge, values and skills, and subsequently
the new competences acquired at any given point.

8.3 Scheme of Assessment

The Assessment Model shows that learners shall be assessed using both School


--- Page 87 ---
Based Continuous Assessment and Summative Assessment for both School and

ZIMSEC assessments.

The table shows the Scheme of Assessment where 20% is allocated to School Based
Continuous Assessment and 80% to School or ZIMSEC Summative Assessment.

School Based Continuous Assessment 20%
Summative Assessment | 80%
Total | 100%

8.3.1 Description of School Based Continuous Assessment

Learners shall do one school-based project per form which contributes to 20% of the
end of year final mark. The end of year summative assessment shall then contribute
80%. However, for ZIMSEC public examinations, two (2) school-based projects shall be
considered as School Based Continuous Assessment at Form 6. The two School Based
Projects shall include those done during Form 3 and 4 sessions. Each will contribute
10%.
