Information and communication

tm ao al:

Assumed knowledge

a) A computer is an electronic device used io process. store and
retrieve information.

b) Laptops, desktops, palmtops, notepads and smart phones are
some examples of computers.

c) ICT tools are all the equipment you use in information
communication and technology like radios, television, laptops,
DVD players, digital cameras and drums.

d) A computer has four main parts, a mouse, a keyboard, a system
unit and a monitor.

e) The parts of a computer which you can fouch are called
hardware.

Introduction

Computers can work on their own. However, for them to work
better, they need to have computer peripherals connected
to them. These peripherals can be input, storage or output
devices. The peripherals enhance the functioning of a
computer so that the computer can be used in a better way.
This chapter discusses the various types of input, output and
storage devices.



--- Page 6 ---
Identifying input devices

Input devices are devices that are used to input information into the
computer. They allow us to control and give commands to the computer.
Input devices are part of computer hardware because you can touch
them. The key board and mouse are the most common types of input
devices. Some input devices include a scanner, a digital camera, a
touch pad, and a microphone.

Types of input devices

A keyboard

It is used to enter data and instructions into the computer. The
keyboard is divided into different types of keys, that is, the
alphabetic keys, the numeric keys and the editing keys like
delete, backspace, caps lock, space bar and enter. All these
keys, when pressed, they enter data into the computer.

A mouse

A mouse is a pointing device. You can click,
double click or drag the mouse. A mouse is
used by following the movement of a cursor on
the screen. )

--- Page 7 ---
A microphone

It is used to input sounds into the computer.
Where have you seen a microphone being
used?

A scanner

It is used to save images and written text into
the computer memory. Instead of retyping a text, the same text can be
scanned into the computer then it is saved and edited later.

A digital camera

A digital camera is used to
take pictures and videos. These
pictures and videos are saved
onto the digital camera's
memory. They are then input into
a computer by connecting a
cable from the digital camera
to the computer. They can be
downloaded and saved in a
computer.



--- Page 8 ---
A touch pad

This input device can be used in place of a mouse. The touch pad
is found on a laptop and it works like a mouse. It is used to move the
cursor so that text can be typed into the computer.

A touch screen

This input device is most common on smart phones, Automated
Teller Machines  (A.T.M.) at the banks and tablets. The
device inputs data into the computer when the user touches the
screen to input data on the required menu.

A barcode reader

It is commonly found in shops at till points. If is used to read the
barcode and to output the prices of goods.

. Identify and name the various types of input devices
in your computer lab.
2. Visit your nearest shopping center or fown center and
observe how input devices work.

Output devices

These are devices that enable you to see the data which has been
processed by the computer. Output devices are important because
they enable you to correct any errors that would have been made
when inputting data into the computer. There are many types of output
devices.


--- Page 10 ---
Types of output devices

A monitor

This is the most common type of output device. It can also be called
a screen or Visual Display Unit (V.D.U). The screen displays all the
information you would have input into the computer in a readable form.
The information being displayed is a soft copy.

A printer

A printer enables the user to produce
information on paper. Information is
called a hard copy. A printer
can be connected to the
computer using cables or it can
be wireless. Once the command
to print is sent, information will
be produced on paper from the
printer. There are many types of
printers. Some print black and white

and some are colour printers.



--- Page 11 ---
Speakers

Speakers enable you to
hear sounds like music or even
recorded voices. These can be
connected either outside or inside
a device.

A projector

This is used to output information
on a big screen. Projectors can
be used in meetings for presentations. Nowadays. some churches use
projectors to output Bible verses. At school, the projector can be used
in class for lessons.

connected.

Storage devices

Storage devices are parts of computer hardware used to store and
extract data from one device to another. Information on storage
devices can be kept temporarily or permanently. Storage devices
can be external or internal to the computer.

Types of storage devices

Storage devices can be put into two main groups and these are:
1. Primary storage devices
2. Secondary storage devices

Primary storage devices are smaller in size. They are internal to
the computer and they hold data temporarily. Secondary storage
devices can be called back up storage devices.They can be internal
or external. Secondary storage devices store large amounts of data
because they are bigger in size.

Identifying storage devices
Magnetic disks

These are storage devices that use magnetic process to write,
rewrite or access data. Hard disks and floppy disks are examples of
magnetic disks.

A hard disk drive

This is the most common type of
storage device which all the computers
have. The hard disk drive is inbuilt in
the computer and it stores the
operating system, applications and
files for The Compuier users.

A floppy disk

This is a small plastic plate coated with
magnetic material. If is used to store
and transfer data from one computer to
another. We can read and write data on
a floppy disk. However, these have been
replaced by Universal Serial Buses (USBs).

Optical disks

Optical disks are storage devices that are flat
and circular in shape. These include Compact
Disks (CD) and Digital Versatile Disks (DVD). These
optical disks differ in the way they can be used
as storage device.

Table 1.1 | CD storage devices |

DVD-R Digital Versatile Disk Read only these disks.

CD-RW Compact Disk-Read Writable The contents on these disks
DVD-RW Digital Versatile Disk Read Writable | can be edited. You can delete
and save new information.



--- Page 14 ---
External hard drive

It has a very big memory and is portable, therefore, it can be carried
ground. It has a memory much bigger than that of flash drives. It can
store information in large amounis.

A memory stick

This is a small piece of hardware
used to transfer information using
USB. It is also known as a flash
memory or flash drive.

A memory card

This can be inserted directly onto the /
device like a smart phone. It can also
be inserted into a card reader then
connected through a USB port. Memory

cards vary in sizes depending on the
amount of information you want to store.

Creating and publishing:
) databases

Assumed knowledge

a) Data can be classified in various ways.
b) Branching databases can be created using prepared tables.

Minifeaucion, 0,

| A database is a structured set of data held in a computer,

especially one that is accessible in various ways. Database
is very important for schools, different organisations and our
country. Imagine you have lost your birth certificate and you
want to get another one from the registrar's office. The officers
there simply search your name and get all your details in a
short period of time. Hospitals, use the database to record a
patient’s details and the information will be used in different
departments. For example, if they want to check your bills,
the accounts department gets your details from the hospital
database.

You can create a database for your class. This topic will take
you through the steps required to come up with a database


--- Page 28 ---
Database

Database is a collection of information that is organized so that if can
be easily accessed, managed and updated. A school may have a
collection of names of all learners. However, these learners can be put
into different clubs or groups. Here are examples of groups that can be
found at a school.

a) traditional dance group b) school choir
c) science club d) soccer team
e) debate club f) life skills club

This information is needed by the school administrators so that when
they are doing their budgets, they have all the details of the students in
these groups. Database makes the administrators’ job easy. The table
below shows how a database looks like.

At the top of this table is the fable name. Boys. Below the table name
are column names: ID, Surname, First name, DOB and Address. These
are known as field names in database. Many field names can be
added depending on the information to be recorded. This means that
a database can contain as much information as the data capture may
want to record. A database can contain information like email address,
cell phone number, as well as, age of a person. However. there is a slight
difference with a word document. Information in database is made in



--- Page 29 ---
such a way that a field, for example, cell phone numbers, must contain
information that is uniform. If numbers are written as +263 700 000 000
then all the numbers in that field must start with +263. The field would
then be like the one below:

Please note that after completing the table, you simply close it because it
saves the data automatically.

Database graphs

Information from the database can be taken and exported to a graph.
This process requires you to go through the creation of a table as given
previously. After creating a table, you can now send it to Excel so that a
graph can, be produced. Although it is a rare case that databases can
be presented by graphs, it is quite interesting to note that the information
on the database can be exported fo a graph. However, you must be
careful, in that, if the database has many fields, then presenting if as a
graph can be difficult. Having many fields means that the graph is also
going to have many bars, therefore it can become difficult fo work with.

Key points

a) Graphs on database are not compulsory. What is
important is for you to be able to put information on a
database.

b) Always name your tables and files. Do not leave any
table unnamed because it will become difficult to get it
when you want to work on it.

c) All rows in database must be filled in. A blank row in

| database is treated as if it has some information and
this affects the database when you want to access your
information.

d) Itis important that you always adjust the width of a field

so that all the details appear clearly.

When these steps are completed you can access your new folder on
the desktop.

1. Type a word document of not more than one page
and save it on desktop following the following
instructions:

a) Save your document on the deskiop.

lb) Name your folder - Grade Four Class.

c) Give your document your own name.

Saving data on external storage and renaming the devices

Saving data on a flash disk and external hard drive.

Step 1

Connect your storage device on a USB port and make sure it has been
recognised by your computer.



--- Page 52 ---
Step 2
Click on the Office button and select Save As option.

Step 3
After identifying your storage device click on it and create a new folder
in it. Always name your new folder for future identification.

Step 4
Open your folder, click Save and save your document in the new folder.

Saving data on a CD and DVDs

You can save on these two storage devices as you have done on the
flash disk. However, when you insert your CD, you need to select an
option which requires you to save as a USB flash. Once that option has
been chosen, you can now repeat the steps you have done on the
fiash disk or external hard drive.

Copying files to and from storage devices

It is important that you know the names of your storage devices as
they appear on the computer, or it will be wise for you to rename your
storage device so that it will be easy to transfer the files.

Here are the steps to transfer the files:

Step 1

Insert your storage devices onto the computer and make sure you have
identified the device.

Step 2

Open the devices with the file you want to transfer.

Step 3

Put your cursor on the name of the file or document you want to transfer
and right click on it.

Step 4

Choose option Send to and select the other device where the data is
intended to go.



--- Page 53 ---
Alternatively, you can save the documents using the Save As method.
The steps involved here are simple as you save the same way you
save a document on a desktop. In this case, instead of choosing the
desktop, you now select the device where you want the data.

Activity 5.3

Open a folder you saved on the desktop and save it on CD as
follows:
a) Name your folder Grade Four (CD).
b) Change your file name to Revised edition.
¢) Create another folder on that CD and name it Folder Two.
d) Save the document in folder Grade Four (CD) into Folder Two.
e) Now transfer the folder from the CD to a flash disk and
name the flash folder — Folder Three.
f) Repeat the same process fo move a document from a
desktop to flash disk.
Name your document - Moved Document.

Key points

When saving a document in a storage device, always

use the Save As format.

Make sure that your documents are saved using

different names.

Two documents with one name cannot be saved in

one storage device.

d) Avoid creating a shortcut for a folder saved on any
storage device as it cannot open on another computer.

e) Only documents can be transferred using the Save As
method. You cannot use the same method to transfer
an application.

f) For applications, use the copy and paste method or

the sendto option. —__

Inserting an image using Microsoft Word

An image is a representation of the external form, of a person or
thing, in art form. This exercise is different from the one of drawing
as in this case the quality of the image would have changed. You
will be dealing with real pictures taken by cameras. This means that
the quality of the image would have changed from simple shapes
and scribbling to real images.

Safety and security: computer
viruses

Assumed knowledge

a) Data is very important it must be protected.
lb) Data and files can be protected using passwords.
c) Information can be safeguarded using physical security.

Introductio al

What is a computer virus? A computer virus is a malicious
program that can infect a computer. It is a piece of code
which can copy itself and typically has a detrimental effect,
such as corrupting the system or destroying data.

A computer virus

A computer virus can:

a) change the files on a computer without the owner of the file’s
consent

b) delete the files from the computer

¢) cause the computer to fail to boot by attacking the boot sector of
the hard drive

d) cause software programs to work in a way which is different from
what the developers expected them to do



--- Page 70 ---
SS

©) Cause a computer to become very slow and fail to process data
because most of the processes will be left incomplete and they
will be timed out

f) multiply itself

How are computer viruses spread?

Computer viruses, are usually spread from one computer to the other
in the following ways.

1. Removable disks

2. Downloads from the Internet

3. Email attachments

1. Removable disks
Examples of removable disks which can spread viruses include,
among oihers:
Q) iiash disks
D) _ stiff disks
c) t-+flashes
If a removable disk is used on a computer with a virus, the disc will be
infected. If an infected disk is used on another computer without a
virus, that computer will be infected and the chain goes on and on.
It is advisable not to use foreign storage devices in the lab because
you do not know whether they have viruses or not.

2. Downloads from the Internet
Downloads from the Internet are another way of spreading viruses.
You must download only from sites which you know.

3. Email attachments
Viruses can be sent to you as an attachment. The moment you
open the attachment, your computer will be infected. Do not open
attachments from people you do not know, or from where you were
not expecting to receive.

Using search tools and search engines

What are search tools?

An online web has a lot of information to give. You need to know how
to access this information in a manner that will be meaningful to you.
Search tools are places on the Internet you can use to explore the
web and find information from the Internet with ease. Search tools help
you to stay safe on Internet sites and they make it easy for you to find
information. Search tools have information put in categories, hence it
is easy to find. Examples of search tools are search engines, subject
directories, invisible web and social media. In this chapter, we will talk
about how to use search engines to find information.

What is a search engine?

This is a software that is designed to search for information from the
World Wide Web (www). Search engines can search for documents by
using a word, words, questions or phrases as entered by the user in the
search box.

How to get the best results from an Internet search

1. Make sure the key words are written clearly.

2. Use more than one key word in your search.

3. Spell your words correctly.

4. Use more than one search engine so that you can compare the
information.

Internet

Now that you can search for information from the Internet, it is important
that you are able to use the information you get to answer specific
questions. It is also very important to read all the information when your
page opens so that you understand what the page is talking about,

and you relate this to your question.

| The introduction of computers has created jobs for
people. While some can make and repair computer hardware,
others can make and repair computer software. You also have
some who cannot repair any part of a computer but are able
to use the computer fo perform many tasks very well. This
chapter, looks at the roles of computer operators and copyists.

What is a computer operator?
A computer operator is a person who works with computers daily and
is also able to fix problems related to the computer. This means that,
depending on the job they are doing, computer operators can be
found in different work places. School clerks, managers, engineers,
receptionists, computer programmers and technicians are some
examples of computer operators. This is because they work with
computers in their work places though in different ways.

rE



--- Page 90 ---
What are the roles of computer operators?

Depending on the job they are doing or where they are working,

computer operators may have several duties. These are some of the

duties they perform:

1. Entering data or typing
A computer operator is responsible for entering data as numerals,
texts or graphics. The data may also include that which will enable
the computer to work properly.

2. Installing computer systems
Some computer operators are responsible for installing computer
systems or applications that will enable computers to perform
certain tasks.

3. Repairing computers
Compuier operators have a wide knowledge in computers. Their
knowledge enables ihem io be able to repair computer hardware
and sofware. They can find oui where the problem is and make the
necessary repairs. Some compuier operaiors are experts in repairing
computer hardware, others deal with software only while others can
do both.

4. Maintaining databases
Some computer operators maintain databases for customers
daily. In a school set up, for example, the computer operator may
have a database about school enrolments per grade or per class
and so on.

5. Storing computer related items
Operators are responsible for keeping computer related items such
as disks. The disks may contain information about their organisations
or they can be disks containing application installation set ups. They
also back up data to external storage devices. They keep these items
safely so that they can retrieve them the next time they are wanted.

6. Setting up controls
In big organisations where computers are used by many people or
in many departments, computer operators have a big role to play.
Compuier operators will set up control systems that prevent the
computer from damage. The control systems may include setting
up passwords and continuously checking and altering computer
networks so that they continue to work properly.

7. Monitoring the use of computers
The use of computers needs to be monitored so that they are used
for the purposes which they were bought for. Computer operators
have a responsibility of monitoring the use of computers so that
they are not misused. In a school set up, the computer operator
can monitor the use of computer by continuously checking the sites
being visited by learners on the Internet. Some of the sites can be
blocked so that the learners only have access to the one suitable
for them.

The role of a copyist

What is a copyist?

Acopyist is an individual who makes copies of
documents. Copyists have knowledge about
computer programs, hardware and software
and can use this knowledge to perform their
job. A copyist uses devices like a photocopier,
scanner and printer.

devices shown above. The documents can be in hard or soft copy.
Sometimes the copyist can make the copies in colour or black and
white depending on what is required.

2. Typing documents
Copyists are responsible for typing, formatting and editing
documents just like computer operators. Because of this role, they

are also called copy-typists.

a) Programming uses many languages.
b) Programming languages can be downloaded for free from the
Internet or they can be bought.

~ Introduction
Programming is the process of writing computer programs, for
example, a planned series of future events or performances.
There are many programming languages which are used,
for example, Scratch and Logo. In this book, most of the

examples will be coded using Scratch programming. Scratch
can be downloaded for free from the Internet.

A program

A computer program is a sequence of instructions to be followed by
the computer. A sequence or a block of instructions in programming
is also called a script or a simple program.

Example: Program 1

Write a script to:

1. Say “Good Morning”.

2. Then change colour by 25.

3. Then think “Hmmm...” for 2 seconds.
4. Then change colour by 80.

5. Change size by 200.

Solution

1. Drag all the instructions from the menu to the centre script area.
2. Connect them into a single block.

3. Edit the parameters to get the required numbers.

Your program should look like this:

i auitch to. cestume epstrel

} next costume

ie costume #

A sequence of instruction

1. The first instruction is done first.

2. The second instruction is done second.

3. The last instruction is done last.

NB: Instructions should be taken as per their order.

Modifying sequence of instructions

1. For program 1 to run, a control must be included in the program.

2. From the control menu drag this instruction.

3. After adding the instruction fo run the program click the green
flag.

Developing a simple game

1. You must change a Sprite type by importing the Sprite.
2. Use the Paint New Sprite to draw a hammer.

3. Import a buffalo.

| New sprite: a ey oo 4

we =

Spritel © Sprite? |

1. You can make the hammer to move by using the motion
menu.
2. Create two costumes.



--- Page 101 ---
For the hammer to work use the following commands.

Ty set size to &) x

The wait will assist you fo see the movements of the Sprite.
After using these commands, the hammer will move once. For it to
move many times you add the Forever command.

1. Use the commands to program a working

2. Edit the scripts to wait for 3 seconds.
- 3. Change a sprite fo a car.

4. Use the following commands 4;

5. Change the variablesand | F- [
record the changes on a
piece of paper.

Key points

a) Instructions are executed by the computer one after
the other unless another instruction tells the computer
fo move to a certain part of the program.

b) The position of the sprite must always be noted before
running the script, otherwise the program will give
incorrect results, for example, you can instruct the
sprite fo turn 90° anticlockwise, but it might end up
facing the wrong direction.

Cc) Scripts must have the start and stop command.
