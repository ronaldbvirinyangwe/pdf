1.0 PREAMBLE

1.1 Introduction

The Indigenous Languages Forms 1 - 4 syllabus is a progression from the Junior Syllabus.
It promotes the development of language skills to enhance communication and instill
indigenous values and norms. The syllabus intends to develop the linguistic skills of
listening/observing, speaking/signing, reading and writing/brailing as well as cognitive,
technical, digital, socio-emotional and other 21! Century skills necessary for life and
learning. The teaching and learning of visual, manual and tactile skills is emphasised to
foster inclusivity. This heritage- based syllabus is intended for use by both formal and non-
formal learners in the development of individuals who conform to the norms and values of
their culture (Ubuntu/Unhu/Vumunhu).

1.2 Rationale

The syllabus aims to promote heritage-based education by developing learners’ proficiency
in Indigenous Languages. It seeks to preserve cultural heritage, empower learners to value
their linguistic roots and foster critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving skills. Through
a comprehensive and inclusive approach, learners will develop listening/observing,
speaking/signing, reading and writing/brailing skills in indigenous languages, explore
cultural significance and historical context and apply these to economic development
through entrepreneurship.

1.3 Summary of content

The Forms 1 — 4 Indigenous Languages syllabus focuses on the development of
macro linguistic skills of listening/ observing, speaking/ signing, reading and writing/
brailing. The syllabus also promotes the 21 century skills such as problem solving,
creativity, critical thinking, innovation, teamwork, digital skills, self- control and
research. These skills will be developed through the following topics: Comprehension
and Summary, Composition, Language Usage, Language Structures and Literature.


--- Page 5 ---
NB: The linguistic skills are developed using the topics. They are not taught in

isolation but complement each other.

1.4 Assumptions

It is assumed that learners:

are able to communicate in an Indigenous Language
are motivated to learn Indigenous Language

have an appreciation of tangible and intangible heritage
have been exposed to creative writing

have knowledge of ICT

1.5 Cross-cutting themes

The following are some of the crosscutting themes that have to be taken into

consideration in the teaching and learning of Indigenous Languages in Forms 1 — 4:

Health and wellness

Disaster risk, reduction and management
Climate change

Information Communication Technology
Entrepreneurship

Environmental management

2.0 PRESENTATION OF THE SYLLABUS

9.0 ASSESSMENT

Indigenous Languages Form 1 to 4 shall be assessed through School Based Continuous
Assessment (SBCA) and Summative Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by
the principles of inclusivity, practicability, authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity and
reliability. The principles are crucial for creating a supportive and effective learning environment
that fosters growth and development in learners at secondary level. Those aspects that cannot be
assessed through the SBCA and SA modes will be assessed through learner profiling.
Arrangements, accommodations and modifications must be visible to enable candidates with

special needs to access assessments.
9.1 Assessment objectives
Learners will be assessed on their ability to:

9.1.1 locate detail and answer comprehension questions based on given texts

9.1.2 deduce the contextual meaning of words and phrases as used in a text

9.1.3 summarise events in a text

9.1.4 plan, organize and write different types of compositions displaying knowledge and
understanding of a variety of issues

9.1.5 construct, spell and punctuate words, phrases and sentences correctly

9.1.6 complete, interpret and use figurative language correctly

9.1.7 explain the construction of various grammatical structures

9.1.8 evaluate appropriateness of the title of a set text

9.1.9 explain themes, lessons, conflicts raised in texts

9.1.10 critique actions, feelings and qualities of characters in texts

9.1.11 identify literary techniques used in texts

9.1.12 analyse heritage, cultural aspects and practices portrayed in literary works

9.2 Assessment Model

Assessment of learners shall be both Continuous and Summative as illustrated in Figure 1. School
Based Continuous Assessment shall include recorded activities from the School Based Projects
done by the learners. The mark shall be included on learners’ end of term and year reports.
Summative assessment at school level shall include terminal examinations which are at the end of
the term and year.

contribute 20% to the end of term and year mark. Public examination candidates are expected to
complete 2 school-based projects at Form 3 and Form 4, which will contribute 20% to the final mark

at form 4.
