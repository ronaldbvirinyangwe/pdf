Read the passage and answer the questions that follow

The moon Coa ye
The moon is one of the many natural objects of satellites. It moves in space
round the planet earth on which we live. The distance from the earth to the
moon is three hundred and eighty-four thousand, four hundred and three
kilometres. The moon travels right round the earth in just twenty-seven and a
third days. It travels at the speed of nearly four thousand kilometres per hour.
That is eighteen times the speed of our fastest cars.

The moon has no light. It gets its light from the sun. sometimes the earth comes
in between the sun and the moon. Then the earth prevents the light from the
sun getting to the moon. When that happens, the moon gives no light at all.
That is when we get the eclipse of the moon.

In 1966, a Russian space-craft landed on the moon. In 1969, America sent
three men to the moon in a space craft known as the Apollo 1 1. The first person

30


--- Page 32 ---
to land on the moon was Neil Armstrong, an American. The surface of the
moon is about the same in area as the continent of Arica. There is no rain that
falls on the moon. The moon is very hot during the day and very cold at night.
The surface of the moon is very uneven. It has high mountains and deep
valleys. The highest point on the moon is Mons Hygen. It is four thousand,
seven hundred metres high. This is about half the height of Mount Everest, the
highest mountain on earth.

Muslims follow a religion called Islam. There are over a billion Muslims all over
the word. Islam is the main religion in the Middle East and in North Africa.
Muslims believe in one God called Allah. Mohammad, is the greatest prophet and
teacher of Islafh. Mohammad gréw up as an orphan. Later, he married a rich
widow called Khadija. The teachings of Islam are written in the Koran. This is
the Muslim Holy Book. Muslims must pray together on Fridays. They also must
pray five times every day facing the direction of Mecca. Mecca, a city in a country
called Arabia, is Islam’s holy city. The Imam leads in the prayers at a Muslim
church called a mosque.

In their lifetime, all able Muslims must go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. A
pilgrimage is a holy journey a person makes to a holy place to pray. Nowadays
many pilgrims travel to Mecca every year to pray. There they pray near a special
place called the Kaaba, in a large mosque.

Muslims are very strict with their religion. In the month they call the Ramadan,
all Muslims are fasting. During the fasting, they do not eat or drink anything
during daylight hours. That means no food or drinks between dawn and dusk.
Muslims strongly believe that all things belong to Allah. Therefore, all things
should be shared by all the people. For this reason, Muslims give food, clothes or
even money to the poor.

Masvingo

14 April 2017
My dear Anna
I am very happy to write this letter about my new school in the city of Masvingo.

My school is called Shakashe Primary School. It is in Rujeko Township a few
kilometres south of the city. Our home is very close to the school. The walk to
school takes me a few minutes. I am never late for lessons.

Shakashe is a beautiful school surrounded by a high durawall. There are eight
blocks of classrooms and wide playgrounds. We keep the grounds clean by not
throwing litter everywhere. We also pick up any litter from the grounds. We also
plant beautiful flowers along the pathways.

The headmaster is Mr J.J Mtero. My class teacher is Miss Goto. All our teachers
want polite, obedient and hardworking students. We greet our teachers everyday
and say goodbye when we go home.

There are forty-two learners in my class. I am the class prefect. My favourite
subject is science. I also enjoy doing Home Economics, especially cooking and
baking. The learners at Shakashe play many games and sports. Thursday is our
sports day. Besides playing netball, I also sing in the school choir. My brother,
Rugare, plays in the boy’s senior soccer team where he is the star. All the learners
at Shakashe know Rugare.

Please, tell me about your school. How are you? I am very well.
Your loving friend
Susan
