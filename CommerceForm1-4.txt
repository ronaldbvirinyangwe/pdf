The Heritage-Based Commerce syllabus learning area for Forms 1-4 shall be assessed through
School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and Summative Assessment (SA). These

learning environment that fosters growth and development in learners at secondary school level.
Arrangements, accommodations and modifications shall be visible to enable candidates with
special needs to access assessments.

This section covers the assessment objectives, the assessment model, the scheme of assessment,
and the specification grid.
