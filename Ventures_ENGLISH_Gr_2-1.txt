Building a sentence

Building a sentence is like building a wall, with words as the bricks.

You need to use nouns and verbs to build a sentence.

You cannot make a sentence without a verb.

A verb is a doing word, like: look, run, walked, sit. They are all things
that you do.

In the brick sentence, the verb is walked. The nouns are van and
town.

sat down to rest on a log. As he sat there, an old woman came by.
"Boy!" she called, "give me your arm and help me to the market."
Tino was a nice boy, so he said yes. He got up from the log, took the
old woman's arm, and they set off down the road. They walked far

Tino took the old lady to a seat near the market stalls. Then he went
to buy the mealie meal. He also brought the old lady some water fo
drink. She was very grateful for the water, for she was thirsty. “I must.
buy some apples,” said the old lady. Tino thought that she looked
too tired. He told her to stay sitting, and went to look for an apple
stall. Tino looked and looked, and at last he found an apple stall.
There were just two apples left. Tino bought them and took them to

As the old lady took the apples, a strange thing happened. The

front of Tino stood a beautiful young lady. He gasped, and looked
and looked. "Tino," she said,” you are a good and kind boy. Take

Elie elephant began to race,
As fast as she could run.

| And they were having fun.
For Ellie was so big, you see,
| It made her very slow.
And Millie was so small that she
| | Was far behind, and so,
|

They stayed together all the way
To find a place to stay. |
And that's why Ellie's nice new house |
Was right next door fo Millie Mouse. |
