Introduction

The Heritage Studies Syllabus covers four years of secondary education (Form 1 — 4). The syllabus
covers the national history of the people of Zimbabwe, liberation struggle, natural resources, cultural
norms and values, beliefs, historical sites, indigenous crafts and food heritage.

The focus of the syllabus is on facilitating the learner to become a responsible citizen of Zimbabwe, who
is patriotic, competent, self-reliant and has a sense of national pride. The syllabus also aims at
upholding the spirit of Uobuntu/Unhu/Vumunhu (societal norms and values). It is envisaged that the
syllabus will produce a creative learner who has the knowledge to explore and exploit the available
resources for survival. The syllabus utilises Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to enhance
the teaching and learning of Heritage Studies.

Rationale

The Heritage studies syllabus seeks to develop individuals who have a collective responsibility for
protecting and investing in their cultural, natural and liberation heritage for posterity and wealth creation. It
develops a spirit of national consciousness and moulds the human character which is the foundation of
Ubuntu/Unhu/Vumunhu (norms and values).

The syllabus seeks to uphold our national unity, sovereignty and governance by embracing the
Zimbabwean Constitution, national symbols and events which foster patriotism, national identity and a
sense of pride and ownership of means of production.

Summary of Content

The Heritage Studies Syllabus’ main thrust is upholding and sustaining national history as well as
preserving the gains of the liberation struggle. It inculcates Ubuntu/Unhu/Vumunhu (cultural
norms, values) among learners. The syllabus deals with cultural beliefs, practices and national
symbols. It also instils innovative, problem solving, critical thinking, leadership, communication,
enterprise and technological skills.
