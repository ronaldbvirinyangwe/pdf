9.0 ASSESSMENT
The Heritage-based Combined Science learning area at Lower Secondary school level (Form

1-4) shall be assessed through School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and Summative
Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles of inclusivity,
practicability, authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity and reliability. The principles are crucial
for creating a supportive and effective learning environment that fosters growth and development
in learners at secondary level. In addition to SBCA and SA those aspects that cannot be assessed
through the continuous and summative modes will be assessed through learner profiling. The
aspect to be profiled will include soft skills among others. Arrangements, accommodations and
modifications must be visible to enable candidates with special needs to access assessments.
This section covers the assessment objectives, the assessment model, the scheme of

assessment, and the specifications for continuous assessment.

9.1 ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES

The following objectives reflect those aspects of the aims that will be assessed. Specific
behavioural learning objectives are stated in each section of the syllabus.

9.1.1 KNOWLEDGE AND COMPREHENSION

Learners should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:

scientific instruments and apparatus, techniques and aspects of safety;

scientific units, terminology, symbols and conventions;

scientific quantities and how they are determined;

scientific phenomena, facts and laws, definitions, concepts, theories and models;
personal, social, economic and environmental implications of science applications.

9.1.2 HANDLING INFORMATION AND SOLVING PROBLEMS
Learners should be able to demonstrate, in familiar and unfamiliar situations, their ability to:

extract information relevant to a particular context from data presented in diagrammatic,
symbolic, graphical, numerical or verbal form;

use data to recognize patterns, formulate hypotheses and draw conclusions;

translate information from one form to another;

communicate logically and concisely;

explain facts, observations and phenomena in terms of scientific laws, theories and models;

0



--- Page 79 ---
explain technological applications of science and evaluate their associated personal, social,
economic, and environmental implications;

make logical decisions based on the examination of evidence and arguments;

apply scientific principles, formulae and methods to solve qualitative and quantitative
problems;

suggest explanations of unfamiliar facts, observations and phenomena;

9.1.3 EXPERIMENTAL SKILLS

Learners should be able to:

follow instructions for practical work;

plan, organise and carry out experimental investigations;

select appropriate apparatus and materials for experimental work;

use apparatus and materials effectively and safely;

make accurate, systematic observations and measurements, recognising the variability
of experimental measurements;

observe, measure and record results of experimental procedures;

identify possible sources of error in experimental procedures;

draw conclusions and make generalisations from experiments;

extract information from data presented in diagrammatic, graphical or numerical form.

9.2 Assessment Model

Assessment of learners at Lower secondary school level for Combined Science will be both
Continuous and Summative as illustrated in Figure 1. Continuous Assessment will include
recorded activities from the School Based Project and other activities done by the learners
for assessment while summative will include terminal examinations, end of week, month,
term, year or check points assessments.

Fig. 1 Assessment Model

In addition, learners shall be profiled and learner profile records established. Learner profile
certificates shall be issued for checkpoints assessment in schools as per the dictates of the
Teacher’s Guide to Learning and Assessment. The aspects to be profiled shall include
learner’s prior knowledge, values and skills, and subsequently the new competences acquired
at any given point.

9.3 Scheme of Assessment

Learners at Lower secondary level will be assessed using both School Based Continuous
Assessment and Summative Assessment. From Form 1 -4, learners will do a school-based project
per form, per year and per learning area which will contribute 20% to the end of term and year
mark. Public examination candidates at secondary level are expected to complete two (2) school-
based projects per learning area at form 3 and 4 levels, which will contribute 20% to the final mark
at Form 4.
