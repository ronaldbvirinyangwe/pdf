1.0 PREAMBLE

1.1 Introduction

The Heritage-based Family and Religious Studies learning area focuses on the study of the
respective historical backgrounds, beliefs and practices, practitioners, rites and rituals of
selected religions in Zimbabwe and their impact on an individual, family, local, national and
global communities respectively. The Heritage-based Family and Religious Studies (FRS)
learning area is a four-year syllabus that provides learners with opportunities to harness
cognitive, religious and moral experiences. These experiences help the learners understand,
interpret and apply religious and moral concepts to their everyday life. It is a multi-faith
approach to the study of religion, which makes learners to be aware of their respective religious
identities in the context of Ubuntu/Unhu/Vumunhu, religious plurality, as well as both their
horizontal and vertical relationships with their respective families, communities, nation, the
global village and the natural environment.

1.2 Rationale

Family and Religious Studies facilitates the respect for human dignity and diversity. The
learning area is significant in the development of Ubuntu/Unhu/Vumunhu, social responsibility
and a sense of sound ethical norms from other religions. It also leads to the understanding of
the role of religion in the formulation of appropriate ideologies that may help motivate, propel
and sustain development. It seeks to develop a critical reflection of socio-economic and
political issues as well as religious tolerance.

The Family and Religious Studies syllabus enables learners to develop skills in:

Problem solving
Critical thinking
Decision making
Conflict resolution
Leadership
Self-management
Communication
Enterprise
Technology

1.3 Summary of content

This syllabus covers the respective historical backgrounds, beliefs and practices, rituals, rites
and fundamental themes of Indigenous Religion, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The focus is
to draw concepts from these religions to help learners reflect on their lives.

1.4 Assumptions

multi-sensory approaches to teaching such as individualisation, totality, concreteness,
tactility, stimulation and self-activity.

syllabus. Learners will go on educational tours.
