PREAMBLE

1.1 Introduction

This heritage-based Junior Physical Education and Arts Syllabus is designed for Junior Learners (Grade 3 to 7). It outlines core
study areas in Physical Education and Arts (Visual and Performing Arts) with some topics in Arts presented in thematic approach
while integrating the previous competence based curriculum producing an enhanced heritage-based education. It is designed to
ensure access to a Physical Education and Arts learning area regardless of gender, race, religion, handicap and learner’s current level
of participation. It also serves as a base on which to build the learner’s entrepreneurial skills. The syllabus promotes the development
of psycho motor skills and techniques as well as ensuring that learners develop socially, physically, cognitively, morally and

emotionally.

This syllabus intends to develop learner’s aesthetic awareness, understanding and appreciation of Physical Education and Arts
embracing the Zimbabwean diverse culture. It follows a developmental guided discovery and culturally responsive approach
anchored on our Zimbabwean heritage that develops learners’ aesthetic values, health and wellbeing. It develops Physical Education
and Arts programmes that are aligned with curricular standards, promote student learning and contribute to the overall health and
well being while preparing Zimbabwe’s future podium performers who cherish their country and represent it with pride. This

Syllabus serves as a firm foundation for mastery of learning experiences and acts as a pathway for entry into Secondary Education.

1.2 Rationale
This heritage based Junior Physical Education and Arts Syllabus enables learners to discover their potential; cherish their
traditions and culture within the diversity that Zimbabwe is endowed with. It plays a leading role in the multifaceted
development of the learner, therefore it is imperative for learners to acquire competence skills. The learning area plays an
important role of the total growth and development of the learner for lifelong physically active health life. The learning area

encourages learners to explore their individual uniqueness and identity. Through Physical Education and Arts learners

4.0 METHODOLOGY AND TIME ALLOCATION

4.1 Methodology

4.1.1 This syllabus uses testing and measuring to assess, monitor, track, and profile learners' physical and intellectual growth

throughout time. The Physical Education and Arts programs at Junior level employ learner-centred and multisensory
strategies and approaches. Individualisation, concreteness, unity and stimulation principles should help to improve the
application of the following methods:

e Animation

e Demonstration

e = Virtual learning

4,2 Time allocation

4.2.1 Juniors: Grade 3 to 7 to receive eighteen 30 minute periods per week.
Learmers need this time as Physical Education and Arts teaching and learning requires training and creating muscle memory which
builds on activity frequency that offers adequate time for repetitions that allow for body and mental activity automation. It is at
this stage that they consolidate the basic Physical Education and Arts skills. These skills lay a foundation for socialisation,

teamwork and collaboration which are the fundamental principles for participation in individual performance or team activities.
