A family is made up of a group of people who are connected to each other
through birth, marriage or adoption. Families believe in different things. This makes
them part of different religions. These religions impact on family unity and how
they do things. A group of families living in one area, place or region make up a
community. The community, together with the different religions play a big role in
caring for and supporting the needy.

Names

The family name is the one which you share with other members of your family.
This is your surname. Family names are either the father or the mother's name. It
is common in Zimbabwe for the surname to come from the father's side. Married
women often also use the husband’s surname.

Totems
aan@

some family names come from totems. A totem is an animal, part of the body or
an object that a particular group of people uses to represent their family. Most of
the Zimbabwean indigenous people have totems. Indigenous people are people
who originate in a particular place or region. People’s totems are sacred to them.
They do not eat meat from the animal or part of the body of their totem. It is
believed that if you eat meat of your totem you will either lose teeth or suffer some
misfortune. Different families can share the same totem. The pictures above show
some of the totems common in Zimbabwe.

Totems are used as a form of family identity. People of the same totem are like
brothers and sisters. They have a sense of being related. This means one cannot
marry anyone of the same totem. Mariage between people of the same totem
is regarded as taboo and it may anger the ancestral spirits. Once the ancestral
spirits are angry, they may punish people of the area or of the fotem. They do this
by not sending rains or causing some suffering of some sort.

Unit 2 Family and religion

Objectives

By the end of the unit, you should be able to:
1, describe family unity
2. explain family practices in relation to religion.

Background

Family members belong to different religions. There is unity and everyone respects
each other's religion. The coming together of a man and a woman to forma
family is called marriage.

) Key words

religion family unity

2A. Family Unity

Family unity is maintaining oneness and supporting each other as.a group of
related people. Unity in families can be seen during ceremonies and when one
needs help. In Indigenous Religion, families help each other during celebrations
like birthdays, coming of age and weddings. Religion is the belief of the existence
and worship of a God or Gods. During funerals, in Indigenous Religion, families
help with labour, money, food and comforting each other.

In Islam, family is very important. The Islamic religion believes that people have
to be mindful of their relatives, even those who are not part of their religion. The
Iskamic holy book instructs Muslims to be respectful, merciful and caring towards
parents and relatives. The Islamic holy book is the Keran. To maintain family unity,
Muslims believe in regular visits fo relatives and assisting them when there is need.

Christians believe that forgiveness and love maintain family unity. The Christian
Bible instructs Christians to love and forgive, to care for their family and relatives. It
also tells them that where there is unity, God commands a blessing. Christians also
believe that a family that prays together stays together. Christianity says that love
is important and helps maintain unity. Families should spend time together to build

and maintain a special bond.

2B. Family life and religion

Family life is influenced by the religion a family follows. Different religions have
different practices they follow. Their beliefs in handling some things in life differ. For
example, how they treat birth, puberty, mariage, good harvest and death.

a) Birth

Religions celebrate the birth of a new born in different ways. Christians dedicate
a new born baby to God. Some churches hold special services for the baptism
of new born babies that are attended by friends and family. In Islam, a special
prayer is whispered into the right ear of the child by the father. After seven days a
sheep is sacrificed and the baby’s hair is shaved. This is done to show that the child
is a servant of Allah. Muslim baby boys are circumcised when fhey are seven days
old. In Judaism, a male child is circumcised when he is eight days old. Children are
given names at the first gathering. In indigenous Religion, when. a child is born, the
first thing they do is Ululation. This is a sign of welcoming the baby and celebrating
with the parents. In some cultures, it is done by close relatives and friends. The
child has fo stay indoors for at least a week. The umbilical code, in some cultures,
is buried at the father's place of origin. After a month or two, a ceremony is held
to welcome the child. At this time, especially in the Ndebele culture, everyone is
then allowed to see the baby.

b) Coming of age

Coming of age is celebrated in different ways in different religions. Celebrations
of boys and girls differ. For boys. in Indigenous Religion, the most common is the
circumcision initiation ceremony. Jews have a Bar Mitzvah (for boys) and a Bat
Mitzvah (for girls).The bar or bat mitzvah ceremony is usually held after a boy's
thirteenth and a girl's twelfth birthday. In Islam, girls when going through puberty
start to wear hijab (which means banier or screen in Arabic).

c) Marriage

Families have different religious practices when it comes to marriage, In the
Christian religion, the man pays a bride price in the form of cattle and money.
After this is done, a wedding ceremony is held at the family’s church to join the
two before God, family and friends. Islamic marriages are usually arranged. The
husband has to agree on an amount of money to be given to the wife’s family
before marriage. This is called the Mahr. It is then given fo the wife to spend on
anything she wants. In Indigenous Religion, the man pays a certain amount of
money and cattle as the bride price (roora/lobola). The aunts of the girl prepare
kitchen utensils for the bride. The aunts and sisters accompany the bride to the
husband’s home. Among some Jews, if is customary for the wedding couple to
fast on their wedding day. Marriage under Jewish law is a private agreement
between a man and a woman, it does not require the presence of a rabbi or any
other religious official.


--- Page 21 ---
d) Death

In some Christian families, there is a gathering of peopte to comfort the bereaved
and provide labour. The Pastor or Reverend reads the bible and prays for the
family. In some cultures within Indigenous Religion, if a married woman dies,
the husband and his family give money to her family. The body of the departed

} lies in the house for one night before burial, Family and friends spend the whole
night singing and dancing in celebration of the life of the departed. In Judaism,
families meet to mourn the dead. they do so to show respect and comfort the
bereaved.

Objectives

2 the end of the unit, you should be able to:
identify family chores
explain the need to share tasks
list roles in the community
identify the needy in the community

state how religions help the needy.

Background

We all belong to a social unit which is bigger than a family. This unit is made up of
different families and we call it a community.

pp Key words
7 role bereaved community chores

3A. Family roles in the community

Families have roles they play within themselves. They have chores that are done
by all members of the family. Everyone has a role to play in doing duties at home.
However, families also have roles they play in their community. A community is a
group of families living in a particular area. There are some people from different
families who take leadership roles in the community, for example chiefs, councillors,
members of parliament and mayors. These people are supported by their families
to help the community during good and bad times. Families in a community host
different celebrations and ceremonies. In all these different times, other families in
the community support them with food, labour, transport, firewood and money.
When there is death in a family, the community collects money to help. The money
has different names, some call it ‘chema’ and others 'masingewabane'. In the
different occasions, women and girls help with cooking whilst men and boys get
firewood and sef up tents.



--- Page 25 ---
Activity 1

1. In groups, discuss the roles that families play in the community.
2. Draw people in a community project of your choice.

a) Family chores

Look at the pictures below.

Family members share chores at home. Chores are routine tasks, especially
household ones. There are no chores that are said to be done specifically by —
women or men. Both girls and boys can do the same chores. Men and women
can also do the same chores. Family chores involve cleaning the house, washing
clothes, cleaning plates, cooking, watering the garden and flowers and sweeping
the yard. There are a number of chores that can be done in a family. People in
families help each other so as to make sure that all is done on time and in the right
way.

1. In groups, list the chores you do at home.
2. Cut and paste pictures of children doing chores at home.
3. Look at the pictures above. Discuss what is happening in each picture.

Exercise

b) Family roles in the community

The Machida family stayed in a village in Gokwe. The village had a lot of families.
One day their neighbours were celebrating their son's wedding. Early in the
morning Mr Machida and his sons, Fergus and Tafadzwa, went to fetch water for
the function. The girls, Tanaka, Lorraine and Clara helped to clean the yard and
prepare fire places. Mrs Machida cooked the food with other village ladies. Other
girls from the village assisted with cleaning plates. The whole family helped with
the preparations and later on joined in the celebration. Families in this village also
help each other on many other occasions. At funerals they gather to comfort the
bereaved. To be bereaved is when one suffers from the death of a loved one. The
families also help the vulnerable members of the community like orphans and the
elderly.

1. In groups, list celebrations that can be for the whole community.

" 3B. Caring for the needy

3 Communities and religions can help the needy in many ways. They can identify
and keep records of the needy in their societies. People who want to help can do
so through churches, clinics, schools and community heads, They can also collect
things from the community members as well as the church members and give to
the needy according to the records they keep. Christians believe that it is more
blessed to give than to receive.



--- Page 28 ---
“ne needy in our communities are the people who lack some of the basic
necessities such as food and shelter. These include:

e Orphans and vulnerable children

* Theaged

« The handicapped

a) Orphans and vulnerable children

An orphan is a child whose parents are dead. Vulnerable children are those that
lack primary care and protection. Orphans and vulnerable children need help
from the society. There are orphanages and homes for orphans and vulnerable
children. Communities put together donations in cash and kind for these children.
Examples of homes for children are Matthew Rusike in Harare, Emthunzi WeThemba
and Thembiso children’s home in Bulawayo.lIn some communities. there are fields
set aside for helping the needy (zunde ramambo). After harvesting, the food is
donated amongst the needy in the community.



--- Page 29 ---
b) The aged

Within our communities we have people who are old. Most of them can no longer
work for themselves to cover basic needs. They depend on others for food, shelter
and clothing. It is the duty of the community to help them. The community can
help them by making sure that they have food and shelter. Communities also have
homes for the old to make sure they are taken care of. Examples are Entembeni
Old People’s Home in Bulawayo, Greendale Cottages in Harare, Batanai in Gweru
and Rugare in Kwekwe.

¢c) The handicapped

The handicapped are people with physical and mental challenges. These people
are limited in one or more of life's activities. The community can help them by
providing basic needs. They can also be provided with raw materials to make
products they can sell and make a living. This group can also be taught skills such
as basketry, capentry and welding. The things they make can be sold and the
money can be used to buy food and clothes for them. We can also provide them
with things they use for example, a white stick for the blind or wheelchairs and
crutches for those who cannot walk.



--- Page 30 ---
There are different organisations that assist the people in this group. Schools
like King George IV Centre in Bulawayo have children with different disabilities.
The community also donates different things fo the school. Another example
of organisations that help the handicapped is the Jairos Jiri Association. This
association provides educational services to people with disabilities. They also
create awareness to the communities about the things the disabled can do. This is
to make sure that the disabled are treated as equal to any other person and can
be employed like any other person.

6A. Origins of Indigenous Religion

Indigenous Religion started when people in Africa started to live in groups as
societies. From the beginning people believed that there was a God who was a
supernatural being. This God created everything and had to be worshipped. As
time went on people developed various ways and ceremonies of worshipping
God. Indigenous Religion does not have a Holy Book like the other religions. All
practices and values were handed down from generation to generation through
the word of mouth. A generation refers to people who are born and live during
the same time. Young people are taught about the practices of the religion by
the elders.

Activity 1

1. Find out from your elders some practices in Indigenous Religion.

Indigenous Religion believes in the Supreme Being. The Supreme Being is called
God. God has been known in Indigenous Religion by many names. Indigenous
Religion is fully aware that God created everything that we see. It also believes
that God has a living place. Different societies have different names for God. The

names of God refer to what the people believe he has done or what he does for
them.

6C. Sacred places

Oe ae ee ee ede eee

Asacred place is a holy place which is respected. It is used for performing religious
ceremonies. In Indigenous Religion a number of sacred places are used for
worship. In the traditional round kitchen hut there is a special place called home
alter/chikuva/emsamo as shown in the picture above. Birth, marriage and death
rituals within the home are conducted on this home alter.

Trees such as muhacha are sacred trees and most community rituals are carried
out under such trees, In some places a whole forest can be sacred. People are not
allowed to say bad things about the sacred places as misfortune may befall them.
Some hills, mountains and caves are also regarded as sacred. Examples are
Matopos, Nyangani, Chishawasha Hills and caves and Chinhoyi caves. Pools
along some rivers are also sacred. These pools are often associated with mermaids,
creatures which are believed to be half human and half fish. These creatures are
also known as water spirits. People are not allowed to make dirty, these sacred
places.

Well known sacred places such as Njelele Shrine, near Matobo Hills, are used for
rain making ceremonies.

Religious artefacts are important items made for use in religion. They are used in
worship and for praising God. Each artefact has a special meaning attached
to it. Indigenous Religion, just like any other religion, has some artefacts. These
artefacts are used for different reasons and they vary from one ethnic group to
another. The most common artefacts are the traditional gourd, knobkerrie and the
snuff container. The traditional gourd is usually used to carry beer when people
are performing different rituals. The snuff container is used to cary snuff which is
used when performing rituals. Tsvimbo/intonga is a symbol of traditional culture. It
represents authority.

Religious clothing for African spirituality was adopted from the way the ancestral
parents dressed. The clothes were simple animal skins. In some cases, black and
white cloth is wrapped or draped around the body. The spirit mediums svikiro/
amadiozi are usually the ones who wear special attire. What is most emphasized
when people go to places of worship is that they remove shoes. They also remove
other ornamental wear such as head gear and wrist watches. Modern attire is not
encouraged when the rituals are in progress. This is done to show respect for the
shrine.

Activity
I. In groups, collect pictures of different artefacts used in Indigenous Religion.
2. Discuss the use of artefacts and say what they symbolize.

6F. Sacred days: chisi/izilo

In Indigenous Religion, there is a day that is set aside for rest and carrying out of
rituals. This day is known as chisi/iziio. Doing work on this day is forbidden by the
tribal spiritual guardian of that land. It is believed that if one goes to the fields
on this day the spirits of the land will be angry. This can lead to misfortune and a
penalty might be given to such a person by the authorities of that area. Chisi/izilo
is not set on the same day throughout the country. Some rest on Wednesday and
some rest on Thursday or Friday. The local leadership such as vilage head or chief
will monitor and ensure that people respect the day.

the self, family, society and religion. Good morals make us do the right things. There
are many things that show good morals. Respecting elders shows good morals.

family we are born into. As we grow older, we start to understand ourselves and

want. Family members can belong to different religions. It is important to respect
one another's religion.

Each religion has responsibilities. This is what you are required to do as part of the

12A. Respect



--- Page 96 ---
If youremember, in Unit 10 we discussed the importance of respecting one another.
It is important for all people to have respect for each other. As Zimbabweans we
can show respect in many ways.

a) Tolerance

Tolerance is being able to accept others who are different from us. We are different
in so many ways. For example, we follow different religions and we like different
things. When there is tolerance we are able to accept one another with all our
differences.

b) Patriotism

My name is Ropafadzo. | am
a soldier in Zimbabwe. My
parents fought in the liberation
struggle. Their stores gave me
the strength to train and be a
soldier. | have gone for duties
around Zimbabwe to protect
my country. Even in other
countries | go as a peacekeeper.
Soldiers sometimes go to war,
it is part of the work. Now | can
share my stories with my parents
about how we love and protect
our country. It is everyone's duty
to love and protect their country.
Loving your country is called
patriotism.

c) Empathy

It is also important to have empathy. Empathy is when you can share ond
understand what another person is feeling. If someone is sad, you can understand
why they are sad and share in their sadness. Having empathy helps people to
avoid conflicts. It also allows us to help one another.

d) Self-respect

We need to have self-respect. Self-respect is when you show care for your own
self. Itis when you value your beliefs and your feelings. What a person does shows if
he or she has self-respect. A person with self- respect will do positive things. Having
self-respect makes a person happy. It makes you take good care of yourself. It is
also important because other people can only respect you if you respect yourself
first. However, it is still important to respect other people.
