PREAMBLE

Introduction

The Heritage-Based Junior Mathematics syllabus builds from the Infant Mathematics module. The document covers one of
the six learning areas in the Junior School Module. This syllabus intends to foster mathematical knowledge through
practical activities such as ordering, measuring, identifying, classifying, routine manipulation, application and problem
solving. This learning phase seeks to give learners an appreciation of Mathematics as a learning area in their education
and to equip them with Heritage-based life skills. The syllabus is also designed to enable a smooth transition from
Junior to Secondary school learning. The learners will be assessed through both School Based Continuous

Assessment (SBCA) and Summative Assessment (SA).

Rationale
This syllabus is designed to enable the learners to understand and apply mathematical concepts in both modern and

Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) as they are central to most facets of everyday life and enterprise skills. The learning
area cuts across many fields of endeavor and this will help the learners to be versatile in the production of goods and
services. The syllabus promotes critical thinking and problem solving skills, which are key to innovativeness,

entrepreneurship and industrialisation.

Summary of content

The Heritage-Based Mathematics syllabus is designed to cover five years of Junior Education,
forming a firm foundation for the lower Secondary school Module (Forms 1 - 4). The learners will be
exposed to mathematical language through ordering, measuring, identifying, classifying, routine
manipulation, application and problem solving. The syllabus will enable learners to manipulate
objects and interact with both the local and global environments for sustainable development. Topics

to be covered are: Number, Operations, Measures and Relationships.

Assumptions

It is assumed that the learners:

> have numeracy and literacy skills;

> appreciate relationships and collaboration
> participate in team work

> think critically and logically

> have prior knowledge of IKS

>

have prior knowledge of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)

Cross-cutting themes

Mathematics learning will encompass and have a universal thrust on the following cross-cutting themes:

1.5.1 Financial literacy

1.5.2 Collaboration

1.5.3 Health and well being

1.5.4 Climate Change

1.5.8 Children’s Constitutional Rights
1.5.9 Gender stereotyping

1.5.10 Environmental issues
1.5.11 Disaster Risk Management
1.5.12 Children’s Responsibilities

1.5.13 Inclusivity

PRESENTATION OF THE SYLLABUS

The Junior Heritage-Based Mathematics syllabus is a single document. It constitutes: Preamble, Aims, Objectives,
Topics, Scope and Sequence, Competency Matrix and Assessment. The scope and sequence shows the progression
of topics from grades 3 - 7. The Competency Matrix shows the breadth and depth of content to be covered. Inclusive in

this syllabus, is a suggested list of resources which can be used during the teaching and learning.

3.0 AIMS
The Junior Mathematics syllabus aims to:

3.1. develop a positive attitude towards Mathematics

3.2. foster problem solving skills into learners

3.3. communicate mathematical information to develop critical thinking and logical reasoning

3.4 develop mathematical concepts and skills for use in entrepreneurship and other facets of life

3.5 develop psycho-social skills such as self-control and free expression of emotions which
contribute to the development of the learner

3.6 develop an awareness of national heritage in the learning of Mathematics

3.7 promote an awareness of IKS in the teaching and learning of Mathematics

4.0 SYLLABUS OBJECTIVES

Pupils should be able to:

4.1 recall mathematical terms

4.2 recognise mathematical terms

4.3 use mathematical terms, symbols and language

4.4 estimate quantities and measures to a degree of accuracy

4.5 calculate to the given degree of accuracy

4.6 solve mathematical problems


--- Page 8 ---
4.7 demonstrate problem solving abilities in Mathematics
4.8 apply mathematical concepts, skills and techniques in context

4.9 explore mathematical ideas and come up with conclusions

4.10 interpret ready reckoners, tables, pie charts and graphs
4.11 analyse tables, charts, graphs and use them in conducting simple investigations
4.12 incorporate Indigenous Knowledge System (IKS) in the teaching and learning of Mathematics

5.0 METHODOLOGY AND TIME ALLOCATION

5.1 Methodology

The syllabus is based on learner-centred approaches in the teaching and learning of Junior learners. The emphasis is on adopting
methods that will enable pupils to acquire competencies in the physical, social, emotional and cognitive domains using tangible and
intangible heritage. It promotes self-confidence, ethics, Unhu/Ubuntu/Vumunhu and children’s rights and responsibilities among
others. The recommended methodologies are designed to promote and lay a firm foundation for problem solving and critical thinking
in life. The learners should be allowed to develop their own solutions while the teacher facilitates. The pace of learning will be
determined by the individual learner's content mastery. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is

recommended as a problem solving tool.
The following are some suggested teaching and learning methods:

5.1.1 Discovery

5.1.2. Experimentation
5.1.3 Group work

5.1.4 Projects

5.1.5 Songs and dances

5.1.12 Demonstration
5.1.13 Exploration
5.1.14 Games

5.1.15 Role play

5.1.16 Simulation

5.2 Time allocation

It is recommended that Mathematics be allocated at least 3 hours per week for Grades 3 to 7.
NB: 6 periods of 30 minutes

9.0 ASSESSMENT SCHEME FOR THE HERITAGE-BASED JUNIOR MATHEMATICS SYLLABUS (GRADES 3 — 7)

The assessment of the Heritage-Based Curriculum shall be done through both School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and Summative
Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles of practicability, authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity, reliability and
feedback. They are crucial for creating a supportive and effective learning environment that fosters growth and development in young learners. This

section covers the assessment overview model, the assessment objectives, the scheme of assessment and the specifications for continuous assessment.

9.1 Assessment Objectives
Learners will be assessed on their ability to:

9.1.1 recall mathematical terms
9.1.2 recognise mathematical terms

9.1.3 use mathematical terms, symbols and language

9.1.4 estimate quantities and measures to a degree of accuracy
9.1.5 calculate to the given degree of accuracy

9.1.6 solve mathematical problems

9.1.7 demonstrate problem solving abilities in mathematics

9.1.8 apply mathematical concepts, skills and techniques in context

9.1.9 explore mathematical ideas and come up with conclusions
68


--- Page 69 ---
9.1.10 interpret ready reckoners, tables, pie charts and graphs

9.1.11 analyse tables, charts, graphs and use them in conducting simple investigations

9.2 Scheme of Assessment
Grade 7 learners will be assessed using both Summative Assessment and School Based Continuous Assessment.

NB: From grade 3 to 6, learners will do a school based project per grade per year which will contribute 20% to their end of year mark. Public
examination candidates at Primary School level are expected to have completed 2 school based projects, one at grade 6 level and the other at grade 7

level, which will contribute 20% to the final mark at grade 7.
