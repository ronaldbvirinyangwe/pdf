1.0 Preamble

1.1 Introduction

In developing the Heritage-based Mathematics syllabus B, attention was paid to the
need to provide continuity of mathematical concepts from primary school level through
to form 4. The syllabus is intended to empower learners with mathematical skills such
as critical thinking and problem solving for use in solving everyday life problems. This
four year learning course will provide learners with opportunities to integrate and apply
mathematical concepts to other learning areas. It is also designed to inculcate into
learners the ability to communicate effectively. Learners should understand and master
various attitudes, skills, knowledge, concepts and processes in order to investigate and
interpret numerical and spatial relationships and patterns that exist in the world.

1.2 Rationale

Mathematics is a fundamental component of economic education. It is very critical for
driving innovation, entrepreneurship and industrialisation which are key to development.
Therefore it is imperative that learners acquire necessary mathematical knowledge,
skills, values and develop positive attitudes towards application of mathematical
concepts to produce goods and services. This syllabus plays a pivotal role in careers
such as engineering, construction, entrepreneurship, education, medicine, agriculture,
meteorology and other trades.

1.3 Summary of Content

The Form 1 to 4 Heritage-based Mathematics syllabus B covers the theoretical and
practical aspects of Mathematics. The content include simple mathematical operations
and processes that can be applied in other learning areas especially the technical and
vocational education and training categories.

1.4 Assumptions
The syllabus assumes that the learner has:

e grasped the primary mathematics concepts such as:
- . number
- . operations
- measures
- relationships
e acquired the ability to operate some IT gadgets

1.5 Cross Cutting themes
The following are some of the cross cutting themes in mathematics:-

Mathematics Syllabus B Form 1 — 4 2024 1


--- Page 5 ---
e Business Enterprise Skills

e Disaster Risk Management

e Environmental Management

e Gender Equity

e Climate Change

e Health and wellbeing

e Child rights and responsibilities

2.0 Presentation of Syllabus

The Heritage-based Mathematics syllabus is a single document covering forms 1 to 4.
It contains the preamble, aims, assessment objectives, syllabus topics, scope and
sequence and content matrix. The syllabus also suggests a list of resources to be used
during learning and teaching processes.

3.0 Aims
The syllabus is intended to provide a guideline for form 1 to 4 course that will enable
learners to:

3.1develop an understanding of mathematical concepts and processes in a way
that encourages confidence, enjoyment and interest

3.2further acquire appropriate mathematical skills and knowledge

3.3develop the ability to think clearly, work carefully and communicate
mathematical ideas successfully

3.4apply mathematics in other learning areas and in life

3.5develop an appreciation of the role of mathematics in personal, community
and national development

3.6 engage, persevere, collaborate and show intellectual honesty in performing
tasks in mathematics, in the spirit of Unhu/ Ubuntu/Vumunhu

4.0 Objectives

The learners should be able to:

4.1 use mathematical symbols, terms and definitions in problem solving

4.2construct appropriate mathematical models that can be applied in solving
problems in life

4.3 draw inferences through manipulation of mathematical data

4.4communicate mathematical ideas and information clearly and effectively in
various contexts

4.5solve a wide range of problems involving algebraic and geometric concepts

4.6apply mathematical concepts in other learning areas

4.7use |.C.T tools in solving Mathematical problem

4.8 conduct Mathematical research projects including those related to enterprise

5.0 Topics
The following topics will be covered from Form 1 to 4:

e Real Numbers

e Sets

e Money and Finance
e Measures and Mensuration
e Graphs

e Variation

e Algebra

e Geometry

e Statistics

e Trigonometry

e Vectors

e Matrices

e Probability

e Transformations

6.0 METHODOLOGY AND TIME ALLOCATION

6.1 Methodology

It is recommended that teachers use teaching techniques in which mathematics is seen
as a process which arouse an.interest and confidence in tackling problems both in
familiar and unfamiliar contexts. The teaching and learning of mathematics must be
learner centred. Ortho-didactic principles should also be applied during teaching and
learning of mathematics. The following are suggested methods of the teaching and
learning of mathematics

e Guided discovery

e. Group work

e Interactive e-learning

e Exposition

e Demonstration and illustration
e Problem solving

e = Individualisation

e Stimulation

e Self-activity

e Totality and wholeness
e Visual tactile

e Educational tours

6.2 Time Allocation

Six periods of 40 minutes each per week should be allocated for the adequate
coverage of the syllabus

9.0 ASSESSMENT

The Mathematics syllabus B learning area at Lower Secondary school module (Form 1-
4) shall be assessed through School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and
Summative Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles of
inclusivity, practicability, authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity and reliability. The
principles are crucial for creating a supportive and effective learning environment that
fosters growth and development in learners at secondary level. In addition to SBCA and
SA those aspects that cannot be assessed through the continuous and summative
modes will be assessed through learner profiling. The aspect to be profiled will include
soft skills among others. Arrangements, accommodations and modifications must be
visible to enable candidates with special needs to access assessments. This section
covers the assessment objectives, the assessment model, the scheme of assessment,

and the specifications for continuous assessment.

9.1 Assessment Objectives

By the end of the Mathematics syllabus B learning area for Forms 1- 4, learners will be
assessed on their ability to:

9.1.1 recognise and use mathematical symbols, terms and definitions
9.1.2 apply mathematical symbols, terms and definitions

9.1.3 carry out calculations accurately

9.1.4 estimate to a suitable degree of accuracy

9.1.5 approximate to a suitable degree of accuracy

9.1.6 measure to a suitable degree of accuracy

9.1.7 draw tables, graphs, charts and diagrams accurately

9.1.8 read tables, graphs, charts and diagrams accurately

9.1.9 interpret tables, graphs, charts and diagrams accurately

9.1.10 carry out geometrical constructions and manipulations accurately
9.1.11 convert mathematical information from one form to another

9.1.12 deduce and draw inferences through manipulation of statistical data
9.1.13 solve routine and non-routine problems using appropriate formulae,

algorithms and procedures

9.2 Assessment Model

Assessment of learners at Lower secondary school level for Mathematics syllabus
B will be both Continuous and Summative as illustrated in Figure 1. Continuous
Assessment will include recorded activities from the School Based Project and other
activities done by the learners for assessment while summative will include terminal
examinations, end of week, month, term, year or check points assessments.

In addition, learners shall be profiled and learner profile records established. Learner
profile certificates shall be issued for checkpoints assessment in schools as per the
dictates of the Teacher’s Guide to Learning and Assessment. The aspects to be
profiled shall include learner's prior knowledge, values and skills, and subsequently
the new competences acquired at any given point.

9.3 Scheme of Assessment

Learners should be assessed using both School Based Continuous Assessment and

Summative Assessment.

9.3.1 Description of School Based Continuous Assessment

Learners should do one school-based project per form which contributes to 20% of the
end of year final mark. However, two school based projects shall be considered for form
4 public examinations that is project done during their forms 3 and 4 sessions. Each will

contribute 10%.
