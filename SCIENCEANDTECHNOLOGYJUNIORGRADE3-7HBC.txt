1.0. Preamble

1.1. Introduction

The Heritage Based Junior Science and Technology Syllabus is designed to build upon the
foundational concepts established in the Infant phase. The syllabus is hinged on the rich
cultural heritage of our community and focuses to stimulate interest, imagination and critical
thinking. Science and Technology Syllabus discovers the wonders of our natural world from
plants and animals to materials and machines. Traditional scientific knowledge and modern
innovations are used to connect scientific concepts to everyday lives and global challenges
through hands-on activities. By integrating the Science and Technology Syllabus with cultural
relevance, learners are empowered to investigate, innovate, solve problems and become
informed responsible citizens who appreciate our heritage and promote sustainable
development. The learners will be assessed through continuous school-based and summative
assessment system in the form of project-based assessments and hands-on experiences and
demonstrations.

Rationale

The Heritage-Based Science and Technology Syllabus for Junior Education provides an
integration of traditional knowledge and contemporary technologies. Learners will develop
essential critical thinking, problem-solving and collaborative skills through hands-on inquiry
based learning to apply scientific principles to real world challenges and impact the society
positively. The syllabus addresses diverse learning needs and promotes equity by incorporating
local perspectives and knowledge. It fosters responsible stewardship of natural resources and
cultural heritage.

Aims
The Heritage-Based Junior Science and Technology Syllabus aims to:

e develop an understanding of basic scientific and indigenous knowledge concepts
e instil use of traditional technologies to solve day-to-day problems

e develop problem solving skills through hands-on experiences

e analyse scientific information

e cultivate curiosity and exploration

e appreciate innovative solutions

e develop environmental awareness and protection responsibility


--- Page 5 ---
1.4 Syllabus Objectives
The syllabus will enable learners to:

e demonstrate creativity and critical thinking

e demonstrate environmental awareness and protection stewardship

e analyse the need for co-existence of plants and animals in their natural environment
e describe some negative effects of fossil fuels to the environment and climate

e explain basic scientific concepts and principles

e apply Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) to real world problems

e apply problem-solving skills using traditional and contemporary technologies

e construct artefacts using traditional and contemporary technologies

e contribute positively towards the maintenance of their immediate environment

e design innovative solutions using traditional and contemporary technologies

1.5 Assumptions

The Heritage-Based Junior Science and Technology Syllabus for Zimbabwe has taken
deliberate consideration of several assumptions critical for socio-economic transformation. Our
assumptions as a country are based on the context of Zimbabwe's heritage, educational
system, societal needs and aspirations. It therefore becomes critical to consider that learners:

have gone through the Infant Science and Technology Syllabus
are actively engaged in scientific experiences

live in diverse social contexts

have access to and use technological devices

are conscious of their environment

are aware of their obligation towards health and well-being

The general assumption is that a Heritage-Based Junior Science and Technology Syllabus can
effectively integrate science and technology education, fostering a deeper understanding of
scientific concepts, technological innovations, and their relationship with Zimbabwe's heritage.

1.6 Cross-Cutting Themes

The following cross-cutting themes must be considered in the Junior Science and Technology
teaching and learning to foster competence development for life-long learning:

e Inclusivity

e Cultural diversity

e Ethical innovation

e Community engagement
e Climate change

e Digital competencies

e Health and Safety

e Disaster risk management
e Entrepreneurship

1.7 Summary of Content

The Junior Science and Technology Syllabus emphasises integrating heritage-based
knowledge into Junior education and supports diversity. The syllabus covers various topics
aimed at fostering a deep connection with cultural roots while promoting scientific curiosity and
technological skills. Key topics include health and hygiene practices, food and nutrition,
environmental awareness and conservation, and educational technology. It encourages hands-
on, learner-centred activities such as moulding, classifying, constructing, drawing, designing,
programming, promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The syllabus also
addresses cross-cutting themes like digital competencies, climate change, and disaster risk
management, ensuring a holistic approach to junior development. Continuous assessment is
performance based, projects, presentations and observations to evaluate the understanding of

both the scientific and cultural aspects of the learning area.


--- Page 7 ---
1.8 Methodology

This syllabus is based upon a learner-centred participatory approach with emphasis on hands-
on, multisensory, problem identification and problem solving. These attributes encourage
sharing, spark curiosity and promote logical and practical learning. Learner-centred approach
encourages learner to learner exchange of scientific ideas, experiences, knowledge, skills and
attitudes. Innovativeness and inventiveness are strongly recommended in the teaching and

learning of Science and Technology. The following are the suggested methods:

e educational tour

e discovery

e experimentation

e demonstration

e resource person

e science and technical exhibition
e simulation

e case study

e project work

e research

e game

e quiz

e gallery walk

e debate

e nature-based learning
e project

e field trip/ excursion

1.9 Time Allocation


--- Page 8 ---
Ten 30 minute periods per week (5 hours), should be allocated for adequate coverage of

concepts.

13.0 ASSESSMENT
Science and Technology learning area at Junior level shall be assessed through School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and

Summative Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles of inclusivity, practicability, authenticity, transparency,

83



--- Page 84 ---
flexibility, validity and reliability. The principles are crucial for creating a supportive and effective learning environment that fosters growth and
development in learners at junior level. In addition to SBCA and SA those aspects that cannot be assessed through the continuous and
summative modes will be assessed through learner profiling. The aspect to be profiled involves soft skills. Arrangements, accommodations
and modifications must be visible to enable candidates with special needs to access assessments. This section covers the assessment

objectives, the assessment model, the scheme of assessment, and the specifications for continuous assessment.

13.1 ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES
Pupils will be assessed on their ability to:
13.1.1 demonstrate an understanding of scientific and technological concepts.
13.1.2 apply indigenous knowledge systems, scientific and technological concepts to solve real life problems
13.1.3 analyse scientific and technological concepts
13.1.4 describe integration of heritage-based knowledge with scientific and technological education.
13.1.5 evaluate hands-on skills through practical activities that encourage exploration, experimentation, and creativity.
13.1.6 use different forms of data presentation methods to give scientific explanation to a phenomena

13.1.7 demonstrate knowledge of scientific instruments and apparatus including techniques of operations

13.1.8 communicate scientific and technological information logically and effectively.

13.2ASSESSMENT MODEL

84


--- Page 85 ---
The assessment of learners in Science and Technology at Junior School module will follow both Continuous and Summative
assessment. Continuous Assessment will include recorded activities from the School Based Project done by the learners while
summative will include terminal examinations.

13.3 Scheme of Assessment
Learners at Junior School module will be assessed using both School Based Continuous Assessment and Summative

Assessment. From grade 3 to 6, learners will do a school-based project per grade, per year and per learning area which will

86


--- Page 87 ---
contribute 20% to the end of term and year mark. Public examination candidates at Junior School module are expected to

complete 2 school-based projects per learning area at grade 6 and grade 7 level, which will contribute 20% to the final mark at

Grade 7.
