1.0 PREAMBLE

1.1. Introduction

The Forms 1-4 English Language Syllabus is anchored on the heritage-based
philosophy, covering the teaching and learning of English Language. It takes
into account the importance of language as one of the vehicles for
communication and a tool for cultural, political, religious, social and economic
development. The syllabus uses the communicative-functional approach to the
teaching and learning of English Language. It allows for tolerance and
appreciation of individual differences and diversity. The teaching and learning
of the heritage-based English Language aims to produce learners who are not
only linguistically competent, but whose norms and values are firmly grounded
in the appreciation of their tangible and intangible heritage. It seeks to enable
learners to communicate through ethical and responsible use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs).

1.2 Rationale

The heritage-based English Language syllabus for Forms 1-4 seeks to produce
learners who can communicate effectively in a variety of contexts. The syllabus
promotes the development of the four macro language skills namely:
listening/observing, speaking/signing, reading and writing/brailling, and their
sub-skills through learner- centred and interactive methodologies. Through
learner-centred methodologies, the syllabus fosters effective exploration of both
tangible and intangible aspects of our heritage, thereby encouraging cultural
identity, pride and continuity. In addition, it also promotes the development of
21° century skills in learners, thus preparing them to function productively in the
global context.

1.3. Summary of Content

The heritage-based English Language syllabus for forms 1-4 emphasises the
teaching and learning of the four macro skills: listening/observing,
speaking/signing, reading and writing/brailling and their sub skills. The syllabus
also promotes the development of psycho-motor, cognitive and affective
domains in learners through appropriate use of language. The teaching and
learning of English Language involves careful selection of texts and ICT tools to
promote the appreciation of tangible and intangible heritage.

90 ASSESSMENT

The heritage-based English Language learning area at lower secondary level shall be
assessed through School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and Summative
Assessment (SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles of inclusivity,
practicability, authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity and reliability. The principles are
crucial for creating a supportive and effective learning environment that fosters growth and
development in learners at secondary level. In addition to SBCA and SA, those aspects that
cannot be assessed through the continuous and summative modes will be assessed
through learner profiling. The aspect to be profiled will include soft skills among others.
Arrangements, accommodations and modifications must be visible to enable candidates
with special needs to access assessments. This section covers the assessment objectives,
the assessment model, the scheme of assessment, and the specifications for continuous

assessment.

9.1 ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES
9.1.1 Writing/brailling

During and by the end of the four-year programme, learners will be assessed
on their ability to:
