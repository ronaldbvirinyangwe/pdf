1.1 INTRODUCTION

The Heritage-based Geography syllabus forms 1 - 4 is designed to promote an
appreciation and understanding of the earth’s landscape and the relationship between
people and their environment. It encompasses the physical heritage aspects of the
earth such as landforms, climates and eco systems. The syllabus also fosters an
element of the intangible heritage such as cultures and economic development. It
promotes inclusivity and equity in education.

1.2 RATIONALE

The teaching of Heritage-based Geography in the secondary schools will equip
learners with skills to understand geographical concepts including locations, patterns
and processes of phenomena. It is designed to enable learners to appreciate
diversity, valuation, utilisation and conservation of resources. The learning area gives
an opportunity to learners to manipulate geographical data and make informed

decisions in their day-to-day experiences.

1.3 SUMMARY OF CONTENT
The Heritage-based Geography learning area comprises both physical and

human aspects. It also covers, geo-literacy, map reading and fieldwork skills.

1.4 ASSUMPTIONS
It is assumed that learners:

e have a natural desire to explore their environment

e possess basic knowledge of direction and location

e constantly interact with weather phenomena in day-to-day life
e interact with natural resources

e are aware of people engaging in various economic activities

1.5 CROSS-CUTTING THEMES
This learning will develop in learners, an appreciation of:

° environmental management
° disaster risk management
° enterprise skills

° health and wellbeing

PRESENTATION OF SYLLABUS
The Heritage-based Geography Syllabus is a single document covering Forms

1-4.

AIMS
The aims of the syllabus are to:

equip learners with skills in statistical and cartographic techniques
develop practical skills of enquiry, observation, recording and
interpretation of geographical information

promote an understanding of environmental management issues

foster an appreciation of sustainable exploitation, processing and economic use
of minerals and other resources

develop in learners an understanding of topical issues such as pandemics,
climate change and natural disasters

create an awareness of diverse communities and cultural
multiplicity
promote an understanding of environmental patterns, dynamics

and relationships

SYLLABUS OBJECTIVES
Learners should be able to:

demonstrate basic knowledge of geographic information systems
interpret topographical maps, photographs and satellite images
collect, analyse and interpret geographical data
conserve natural resources in the context of both economic
development and environmental protection
develop technologies in issues of climate change
narrate the processes that bring about change in both physical and human
environment
show geographical knowledge in creating solutions to everyday

challenges


--- Page 6 ---
4.8 develop enterprise skills in resource utilisation and conservation
4.9 explain the relationship between physical and human processes in

the shaping of geographic space

5.0 METHODOLOGY AND TIME ALLOCATION

5.1 METHODOLOGY

This syllabus takes into account learner centred approaches and methods. The
choice of teaching methods and approaches should be guided by the principles of
inclusivity, equity, relevance, specificity, gender sensitivity and respect. The syllabus
proposes the use of the concentric, systems and integrated approaches.

The concentric approach: It recommends teaching geography starting from the local
environment, then move to the whole of Zimbabwe, Southern African Development
Community region, rest of Africa and the World.

Systems Approach: It involves the study of inter-relationships of various components
in the environment which make up the whole. The focus is on the inputs, processes
and outputs and feedback in a given system.

The integrated approach: It recommends that related topics should be taught
together rather than in isolation

The following are suggested methods of teaching and learning geography:

¢ Demonstrations

¢ Field work

* Games

¢ Simulations

* Debates

¢ Experimentations

¢ Group work and discussions
¢ Role-play

* Case studies

¢ Project based learning
¢ Educational tours

¢ Individualisation

Five (5) periods of 40 minutes per week should be allocated for adequate
coverage of the syllabus. The teachers should allocate time appropriately for
learners with individual special education needs.

NB: Educational tours should be undertaken at least once a year.

9.0 ASSESSMENT

The Heritage-based Geography syllabus learning area for form 1 - 4 shall be assessed
through School Based Continuous Assessment (SBCA) and Summative Assessment
(SA). These assessments shall be guided by the principles of inclusivity, practicability,
authenticity, transparency, flexibility, validity and reliability. The principles are crucial for
creating a supportive and effective learning environment that fosters growth and
development in learners at secondary school level. Arrangements, accommodations and
modifications shall be visible to enable candidates with special needs to access

assessments.

This section covers the assessment objectives, the assessment model, the scheme of

assessment, and the specification grid.

9.1 Assessment Objectives

By the end of the Heritage-based Geography syllabus learning area for form 1 — 4,

learners will be assessed on their ability to:

9.1.1 demonstrate basic knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS)

9.1.2 interpret topographical maps, photographs and satellite images.

9.1.3 collect, analyse and interpret geographical data

9.1.4 conserve natural resources in the context of both economic development
and environmental protection

9.1.5 develop technologies in issues of climate change

9.1.6 narrate the processes that bring about change in both physical and human
environment

9.1.7 show geographical knowledge in creating solutions to everyday challenges

9.1.8 develop enterprise skills in resource utilisation and conservation

9.1.9 explain the relationship between physical and human processes in the
shaping of geographic space

9.2 Assessment Model

Assessment of learners at Lower Secondary School Level for Heritage-based Geography
Syllabus shall be both Continuous and Summative as illustrated in Figure 1. School
Based Continuous Assessment shall include recorded activities from the School Based


--- Page 98 ---
Projects done by the learners. The mark shall be included on learners’ end of term and
year reports. Summative assessment at school level shall include terminal examinations
which are at the end of the term and year.

In addition, learners shall be profiled and learner profile records established. Learner
profile certificates shall be issued for checkpoints assessment in schools as per the
dictates of the Teacher's Guide to Learning and Assessment. The aspects to be profiled
shall include learner’s prior knowledge, values and skills, and subsequently the new
competences acquired at any given point.

9.3 Scheme of Assessment
The Assessment Model shows that learners shall be assessed using both School Based
Continuous Assessment and Summative Assessment for both School and ZIMSEC

assessments.

The table shows the Scheme of Assessment where 20% is allocated to School Based

Continuous Assessment and 80% to School or ZIMSEC Summative Assessment.

School Based Continuous Assessment 20%
Summative Assessment 80%
Total 100%

9.3.1 Description of School Based Continuous Assessment

Learners shall do one school-based project per form which contributes to 20% of the end
of year final mark. The end of year summative assessment shall then contribute 80%.
However, for ZIMSEC public examinations, two (2) school-based projects shall be
considered as School Based Continuous Assessment at form 4. The two School Based

Projects shall include those done during form 3 and 4 sessions. Each will contribute 10%.

The learning and assessment scheme shows the stages that shall be executed by
pupils and the timeline at which each stage shall be carried out. Possible marks,
totalling 50, are highlighted to indicate how much can be allocated.

9.3.2 Description of the ZIMSEC Summative Assessment

ZIMSEC Summative Assessment shall be a public examination at form 4. The
examination shall consist of 2 papers.
