because:

(i) More stomata/ more pores open allowing water to come out.

-It consists of U shaped transparent tube

-One arm of the tube is connected to the fluid supply

-The pressure of the fluid supply will force liquid inside the manometer to move a
certain height given by hz — hi

-The pressure is calculated using the formula P = D x h x g + atm (atmospheric
pressure)

STATE TWO PROPERTIES OF LIQUID PRESSURE AND DRAW A DIAGRAM FOR EACH
PROPERTY

1) Liquid pressure acts equally at a given depth
2) Pressure of the liquid increase with depth

DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN HOW A SIPHON WORKS

-The pipe should be primed i.e. to get rid of air so as to reduce the pressure inside
the pipe

-The atmospheric pressure will force water to enter into the pipe

-The container which receive the liquid should be a lower level

STATE 3 TYPES OF PUMPS
1. Bicycle pump

2. Lift pump

3. Blair pump

A. Force pump

DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN HOW EACH OF THE FOLLOWING PUMPS WORKS

1. Bicycle pump. When the piston is pulled out the valve (the leather)
detaches itself from the walls of the barell

-The atmospheric pressure enters in the barell to occupy the space

-When the piston is pushed in, the valve attaches itself to the walls of the barell
thereby forcing the valve on the tyre to open and the air enters the tube / tyre

2. Lift pump

Upstroke — Piston moves up, upper valve closes

-atmospheric pressure pushes water to enter through the lower valve which opens
and water flows upwards into the cylinder

Downstroke — The piston moves downwards the lower valve closes and the upper
valve opens

-Water flows into the spaces above upper valve

-After several upstrokes and downstrokes water will; start flowing out of the spout
on each stroke (upstroke)

3. Force pump
Upstroke — The piston moves upwards and the valve on the cylinder opens thereby

allowing water to enter

Downstroke - The piston moves downwards, the upper valve opens and the lower
valve closes

-Water enters into the reservoir where there is air apace for continuous supply of
water through the spout

4. Blair pump

Upstroke —Piston moves up, lower valve opens , upper valve closes

-atmospheric pressure pushes water through the lower valve and water enters into
the cylinder

Downstroke — Piston moves downwards, lower valve closes and upper valve opens
thereby allowing water into spout

DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN HOW HYDROLIC JACK WORKS

-Effort is applied on the small piston
-The pressure is transmitted through fluid to large piston
-Small effort lifts big load on a large piston

DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN HOW THE CAR BRAKE SYSTEM WORKS

-When the brake pedal is pressed down the piston in the master cylinder pushes in
on brake fluid

-The brake fluid transmit the pressure equally to all the four wheel cylinders equally
-The wheel cylinder piston push out against the brake shoes

-The brake shoes push against the wheel drums and the resulting friction slows
down and stops the car

STATE 2 HYDROLIC PROPERTIES OF LIQUIDS

1. Liquid pressure is transmitted equally in all directions
2. Liquids cannot be compressed
